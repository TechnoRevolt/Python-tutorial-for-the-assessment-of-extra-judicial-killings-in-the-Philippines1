  <p> LEARNING PYTHON FROM DISSIDENCE.QUANTIFYING EXTRA JUDICIAL KILLINGS AND THE CONCRETE APPLICATION OF MARXIST ALGORITHMS THROUGH PYTHON IN CALCULATING CORUPTION BEHIND THE LOSS OF THE WEST PHILIPPINE SEA.
  </p>
</div>

<section class = "ejk">
  <p>This Python tutorial is dedicated for those innocent people whose lives were lost since the beginning of a pseudo - crackdown of illegal proliferation of methamphetamine hydrochloride or popularly called "SHABU" that murdered poor Filipinos because they are powerless. The real DRUGLORDS who of course are powerful individuals with closest connection to the law enforcement agencies and the chief executive himself are roaming free.This is the saddest state of reality in the Philippines, if you    are poor who can not afford to have a lawyer then you probably be thrown in a garbage bin wrapped in masking tape, some women were raped before they were stabbed to death inside a sack. These murderers led by a murderous regime, with audacity are proud to call themselves as Christians and that is sick.<br><br>
    The data that will be shown in this tutorial came from reliable sources such as Rappler, Inquirer and the other incorruptible media outlets.Furthermore, this tutorial will also tackle the issue of the West Philippine Sea(the resource -rich area) that this country is fast losing due to treason from above, they were clearly bribed by the Chinese Bureaucrats at the expense not only of the future of my family but also the future of all the
   Filipino families, including yours.</p>

    <p> Before delving deeper, this tutorial expounds complex Python Programming Codes;it is imperative to acquire basic knowledge;this is the link(https://technorevolt.github.io/Python-for-beginners-and-experts-alike/)
     of the website with basic core concepts published in GitHub to follow  along with this tutorial.Providing cleaner data for analysis is fundamental in rendering excellent output, it is vital to gather sleek information to enable a machine(our computer) to digest outstanding data for accurate conclusion and prediction. Bear in mind that behind technological advances is a human intuition and not the other way around, to cut the story short; let us begin coding.

  <div class="desc1">To be part of the lowest stratum in the Philippine society is the saddest reality.For the elites who are in the bureaucracy, these people who were murdered are mere casualties of a war that they have created.In a feudal society such as the Philippines, the poor are born meant to be the slaves of the powerful families and they possess no human rights as well as democracy.</div>

<p> A:WEIGHING THE DATA WITHIN THE DICTIONARY AND A LIST.<br><br>
  Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered = {
                              2016 : 5540,<br>
                              2017 : 8500,<br>
                              2018 : 12658,<br>
                              2019 : 6955}<br><br>

minors_killed, poor_killed, innocent_killed = [.08, .95, .030]<br><br>
Constructing a variable with multiple names is a complex Python operation, each name corresponds according to its location with the location inside the list.For instance, the first name in the variable is minors_killed, logically its corresponding associate within the list is also the first (letter or number) in the array.<br><br>

This program fuses the data in a dictionary and a list for assessing valuable output.<br><br>

Calculating the sum of those who died from 2016 until 2019 can be extracted through the codes below.<br><br>
Step One:<br>
Determine the values.<br><br>
for values in Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values():
    print(values)<br><br>
Running the program yields outputs of:<br>
5540<br>
8500<br>
12658<br>
6955<br><br>

Since the values are rendered,the evaluation of the total number of the murdered civilians will be easier.<br><br>
Creating a variable is also the other logical way of arriving into the sum of the numbers.<br>
a = sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values())<br>
print(a)<br><br>
Or the shorter code.<br>
print(sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values()))<br><br>
The output is still the same.<br>
33653<br><br>
And so the output is heartbreaking,33,653 people died who were accused of being drug offenders.Granting that if they are really too involved in drug trade,the law enforcers should arrest them and tried them in the courts of law instead of killing them or rehabilitate them to become productive individuals in the society.<br><br><br>
A1)Calculating the minors who died out of the 33653 slaughtered civilians.<br><br>
2 ways of concluding the the number of minors killed.<br><br>
1)Longer and logical process.<br><br>
a = sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values())<br>
print(a)<br><br>

b = minors_killed<br>
print(b)<br><br>

c = a * b<br>
print(c)<br><br>

2)Shorter method.<br><br>
print(sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values()) * minors_killed)<br><br>

The output is: <br><br>
2692.2400000000002 minors killed.<br><br><br>

A2)Calculating the number of the poor people killed out of the 33653 victims.<br><br>
a = sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values())<br>
print(a)<br><br>

b = poor_killed<br>
print(b)<br><br>

c = a * b<br>
print(c)<br><br>

print(sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values()) * poor_killed)<br><br>

31970.35 poor Filipinos were killed out of the slaughtered 33653 souls.<br><br><br>
A3)Calculating the death toll of the innocent civilians who were exterminated without justice.<br><br>
a = sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values())<br>
print(a)<br><br>

b = innocent_killed<br>
print(b)<br><br>

c = a * b<br>
print(c)<br><br>

print(sum(Duterte_Regime_Slaughtered.values()) * innocent_killed)<br><br>
1009.5899999999999 innocent civilians killed who died in a crossfire but most were killed for bounty paid by the State.

  <p>B: ACCESSING THE INFORMATION WITHIN THE LISTS, TUPLE AND DICTIONARY FOR FURTHER DATA ANALYSIS.<br><br>
    B1)Extracting data through the use of indexing.<br><br>
    drugwar_killed_names = ['Joseph San Jose', 'Jayson Carbonella','Mary Mae Garcia','Andrew De Luna','Andrea Santo Tomas','Lucy de la Torre']<br>
killed_ages = [ 5, 17, 16, 20, 4, 15]<br>
killed_location = ['Quezon City', 'Ilo-Ilo City','Dagupan City','Cebu City','Laguna','Bulacan']<br>
method_of_death = " Most of the victims who died were either tortured to death while some were placed inside the sack and stabbed to death."<br>
planted_evidence = ('Drug Paraphernalia', 'Antiquated_35_Calibre', 'Fabricated Evidence','False Intel Report', 'Murdered for Bounty', 'Tagged as communist')<br>
sexes_of_killed = {'Males' : 10, 'Females' : 16, 'Lesbians' : 24, 'Homosexuals' : 120, 'Transgenders' : 80, 'Bisexuals' : 45}<br><br>

print(drugwar_killed_names[0]) #Data begins at zero index and ending up in -1.<br><br>
print(killed_ages[-1])<br><br>
print(killed_location[3])<br><br>
print(method_of_death.upper())#Transforming all the letters in upper case.<br><br>
print(planted_evidence[2])<br><br>
print(sexes_of_killed['Homosexuals'])#Accessing the dictionary through indexing.<br><br>
The results of the codes are:<br><br><br>
Joseph San Jose<br><br>
15<br><br>
Cebu City<br><br>
 MOST OF THE VICTIMS WHO DIED WERE EITHER TORTURED TO DEATH WHILE SOME WERE PLACED INSIDE THE SACK AND STABBED TO DEATH.<br><br>
Fabricated Evidence<br><br>
120<br><br><br>

B2)Concatenating the indices within the 2 separate lists.<br><br>
a = drugwar_killed_names[1]  + killed_location[2]<br>
print(a)<br><br>
These lines of codes produce:<br><br>
Jayson Carbonella Dagupan City<br><br><br>

B3): Creating a sentence through indexing and concatenation.<br><br>
a = drugwar_killed_names[2] + ' is just ' +  str(killed_ages[ 1])  +' years old.' + killed_location[0] + ' is where her cadaver was found.'<br>
print(a)<br><br>
The output is:<br>
Mary Mae Garcia is just 17 years old.Quezon City is where her cadaver was found.<br><br><br>

B4)Calculating the average age of those who died in the war on drugs of Duterte.<br><br>
a = (sum(killed_ages))<br>
print(a/5)<br><br>
15.4 is the average age of those who were murdered.<br><br><br>

B5)Calculating the numbers of letters of every data in a list.<br><br>
for w in killed_location:<br>
    print(w,len(w))<br><br>

The result  is:<br><br>
Quezon City 11<br>
Ilo-Ilo City 12<br>
Dagupan City 13<br>
Cebu City 9<br>
Laguna 6<br>
Bulacan 7<br><br><br>

B6)Accessing the specific numbers of characters of a specific information in the grabbed data.<br><br>

a = len(drugwar_killed_names[1])<br>
print(a)<br><br>

17 <br><br><br>

B7)Taking the sum of characters of the 2 data embedded in the 2 separate lists.<br><br>

a = len(drugwar_killed_names[1])<br>
print(a)<br><br>

b = len(killed_location[0])<br>
print(b)<br><br>

c = a + b<br>
print(c)<br><br>

the results of the codes are:<br><br>
17<br>
11<br>
28<br><br><br>

B8)Concatenating 2 data.<br><br>

a = (drugwar_killed_names[1])<br>
print(a)<br><br>

b = (killed_location[0])<br>
print(b)<br><br>

c = a + b<br>
print(c)<br><br>
Jayson Carbonella<br>
Quezon City<br>
Jayson Carbonella Quezon City<br><br><br>

B9)Concatenating through the use of variables.<br><br>

a = planted_evidence[2]<br>
b= sexes_of_killed['Homosexuals']<br><br>
print(a)<br>
print(b)<br><br>

c = a +'is the most terrifying strategy applied by the Filipino law enforcers.' + 'It killed ' + str(b)+ ' innocent Filipinos so far.'<br><br>
print(c)<br><br>

The results of the program are:<br><br>

Fabricated Evidence.<br>
120<br>
Fabricated Evidence is the most terrifying strategy applied by the Filipino law enforcers.It killed 120 innocent Filipinos so far.<br><br><br>



B10) Combining the string with the indexed data through using variable.<br><br>
a = drugwar_killed_names[-1]<br>
print(a)<br><br>

b = a + ' is just one of the victims of the brutal extra judicial killings.' + method_of_death<br><br>

print(b)<br><br>

Lucy de la Torre<br><br>
Lucy de la Torre is just one of the victims of the brutal extra judicial killings. Most of the victims who died were either tortured to death while some were placed inside the sack and stabbed to death.<br><br><br>

B11)Extraction of the total sum of the values in the sexes_of_killed with the values in killed_ages.<br><br>

a = sexes_of_killed.values()<br>
print(a)<br><br>
b= sum(sexes_of_killed.values())<br>
print(b)<br><br>

c = sum(killed_ages)<br>
print(c)<br><br>

d = b + c<br>
print(d)<br><br>
The outputs are:<br><br>
dict_values([10, 16, 24, 120, 80, 45])<br>
295<br>
77<br>
372<br><br><br>

B12)Fusing 2 lists.<br><br>

print(a)<br><br>

['Joseph San Jose', 'Jayson Carbonella', 'Mary Mae Garcia', 'Andrew De Luna', 'Andrea Santo Tomas', 'Lucy de la Torre', 5, 17, 16, 20, 4, 15]<br><br><br>

B13)Changing a word in a string.<br><br>

a = method_of_death.replace("Most", "All")<br>
print(a)<br><br>

All of the victims who died were either tortured to death while some were placed inside the sack and stabbed to death.<br><br><br>

B14)Converting the string into a list with multiple strings within for manipulation.<br><br>

a = method_of_death.split()<br>
print(a)<br><br>

['Most', 'of', 'the', 'victims', 'who', 'died', 'were', 'either', 'tortured', 'to', 'death', 'while', 'some', 'were', 'placed', 'inside', 'the', 'sack', 'and', 'stabbed', 'to', 'death.']<br><br><br>

B16)Counting the strings in a list.<br><br>
a = method_of_death.split()<br><br>
The result of this code is:<br><br>

['Most', 'of', 'the', 'victims', 'who', 'died', 'were', 'either', 'tortured', 'to', 'death', 'while', 'some', 'were', 'placed', 'inside', 'the', 'sack', 'and', 'stabbed', 'to', 'death.']<br><br>
